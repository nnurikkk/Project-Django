# Rental Income Manager - Implementation Guide

I've created a comprehensive Django web application for managing rental properties and income. This guide will help you understand what has been built and how to get started with the application.

## Project Overview

The Rental Income Manager is a full-featured Django application designed to help property owners manage their rental properties, tenants, income, and expenses. It includes:

1. **Property Management** - Add, edit, and track details of all your rental properties
2. **Tenant Management** - Store tenant information and lease agreements
3. **Income Tracking** - Record and categorize all rental payments
4. **Expense Management** - Track property-related expenses and maintenance costs
5. **Financial Reports** - Generate income and expense reports by property, month, or year
6. **Dashboard** - Visual overview of your rental business performance

## Project Structure

The application is organized into several Django apps, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality:

- **core** - Base functionality, user authentication, and dashboard
- **properties** - Property management and related functionality
- **tenants** - Tenant and lease management
- **payments** - Rental payment tracking
- **expenses** - Expense tracking and categorization
- **reports** - Financial reporting and data export

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the Rental Income Manager, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rental-income-manager.git

```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6. Run the Development Server
